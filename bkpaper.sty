\begin{abstract}
Extracting the physical parameters of a dynamical system from videos is of great interest to applications in natural science and technology. Neural networks have addressed this challenge by providing automated methods to parametrize videos. However,  state-of-the-art solutions require large labelled datasets, which are difficult to acquire; besides, such solutions lack physical interpretability. Furthermore, some solutions use unsupervised techniques, which depend on frame prediction, despite they suffer from long training time, instability under different initializations, and are limited to hand-picked motion problems. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the physical parameters of any known governing continuous equation from single videos; our solution is suitable for different dynamical systems beyond motion and is robust to initialization compared to previous approaches. Moreover, we remove the need for frame prediction by implementing a KL-divergence-based loss function in the latent space, which avoids convergence to trivial solutions and reduces model size and computational load.

\section{Introduction}

Estimating the dynamical parameters of physical and biological systems from videos allows us to relate visual data to known governing equations which can be used to make predictions, improve mathematical models, understand diseases, and, in general, advance our knowledge in science and technology \citep{schmidt2009distilling, brunton2016discovering,jaques2019physics}. Use cases include trajectory prediction for celestial objects \citep{hofherr2023neural}, healthy and diseased tissue characterization \cite{gutenkunst2007universally}, and physical model validation \citep{brunton2016discovering, champion2019data}.

Nevertheless, to fit governing equations, also known as the inverse problem \citep{anderson2015chapter}, it is often necessary to either use additional sensors to directly measure system states (instead of extracting them from the video) or to manually obtain pixel or frame level annotations for the whole dataset. Both procedures are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, automated and unsupervised methods are needed to extract dynamics from videos and accurately estimate physical parameters \citep{schmidt2009distilling, brunton2016discovering, jaques2019physics, iten2020discovering, hofherr2023neural}. 

Recent advances in deep learning \citep{watters2017visual,brunton2016discovering, champion2019data} and reinforcement learning \citep{asenov2019vid2param} have addressed this challenge. For instance, proposed solutions rely on datasets with extensive and high precision labels are used in supervised training settings, however, those labelled datasets settings are difficult to obtain \citep{ball2010data, adam2015higgs, libbrecht2015machine, meijering2016imagining, varoquaux2022machine}. Along with this, current solutions constrain their experiments by studying merely motion dynamics, excluding a wide variety of systems like dynamics related to brightness, colour, and deformations, among others\citep{jaques2019physics, hofherr2023neural}. Finally, to fit the physics parameters in an unsupervised fashion, current solutions depend on encoder-decoder network designs to reconstruct frames from low-dimensional representations, leading to complex solutions which are sensitive to initialization, slow to train and require tricks to work, restraining the application \citep{jaques2019physics, hofherr2023neural}.

Our work proposes an unsupervised learning method to solve the inverse problem using videos of a dynamical system with known, continuous governing physics equations. Our method can be implemented for different dynamical systems beyond motion problems. In addition, our approach is faster and less resource-intensive compared to existing methods since it bypasses frame reconstruction by calculating the loss merely from latent spaces, eliminating the need for a decoder. Finally, our method allows an interpretation of the dynamical system. 

\section{Related Work}


The relation of physics and deep learning is broadly explored for different purposes such as getting inspiration or tools from physics to improve performance in different tasks like segmentation \citep{lengyel2021zero}, generative models based \citep{toth2019hamiltonian, takeishi2021physics} and inspire the design of architectures \citep{gin2021deep}. Likewise, deep learning is used to study, understand and create new physics from data \citep{brunton2016discovering, watters2017visual, champion2019data, iten2020discovering}.

One of the biggest challenges in science and medicine is the difficulty in collecting and labelling data, where experiments usually require pricey machines or processes. Besides the need for experts in the subject to label data in science and medicine, in some cases, the data is so abundant that it is not feasible to label it manually \citep{adam2015higgs}. Because of this concern, unsupervised methods are needed \citep{ball2010data, adam2015higgs, libbrecht2015machine, meijering2016imagining, varoquaux2022machine}.

The primary method to solve the inverse problem with AI  is using techniques like physics-informed neural networks (PINN)\citep{karniadakis2021physics} or Lagrangian neural networks (LLN) \citep{cranmer2020lagrangian}; those methods require labelled datasets and work over the dynamical variable of interest. Thus, PINNs and LNNs can make use of the differentiable properties of the deep learning frameworks to estimate parameters in the equations; still, PINNs are usually constrained to initial conditions, boundary conditions, and time reference \citep{karniadakis2021physics, gao2022physics, meng2023pinn}. Due to the properties previously mentioned, PINNS and LLN are not suitable for video data without previous processing or labelling since the dynamics are mixed with geometrical properties, colour and background.

The study of physics recorded in the video is much focused on frame prediction; some of those methods consist of auto-encoder (AE) architectures, long-short time memory models(LSTM), or recurrent models \citep{kossen2019structured, fragkiadaki2015learning, battaglia2016interaction,  guen2020disentangling}, but do not concentrate on estimating physical parameters or using prior knowledge. 

There is some research on extracting physical information from video, like parameters (i.e. friction coefficient) or the value of the dynamical variable (i.e. position, velocity). Nevertheless, those methods learn over labelled datasets with access to the dynamical variables or parameters ground truth \citep{NIPS2017_4c56ff4c, de2018end, lutter2019deep, RAISSI2019686, wu2015galileo, watters2017visual, zheng2018unsupervised}.   Moreover, the methods mentioned so far work over motion problems and are based on systems similar to interaction networks \citep{ battaglia2016interaction,watters2017visual,  velivckovic2022reasoning}, some methods like \citep{weiss2020correspondence, kairanda2022f} try to parametrize and solve differential equations to simulate the deformations. However, dynamical systems are not limited to motion.

Finally, as far as our knowledge, some papers achieve a similar goal to estimate parameters in an unsupervised way; those works' tasks consist of frame representation and prediction by using physics priors of known governing equation with unknown parameter to estimate \citep{weiss2020correspondence, jaques2019physics, hofherr2023neural, NEURIPS2020_79f56e5e, kandukuri2020learning}. \citep{kandukuri2020learning, NEURIPS2020_79f56e5e} use variational auto-encoders (VAE) with a physics engine in between to estimate parameters; however the reconstructions are poor, constraining the model to simple problems and focus on motion, we do not consider \citep{NEURIPS2020_79f56e5e} as baseline since id does not discuss the accuracy in parameter estimation, it is tested on one datseted and is discussed in \citep{hofherr2023neural}. Similarly, we do not compare against \citep{kandukuri2020learning }  since those architectures are scoped in \citep{jaques2019physics}.

We consider \citep{jaques2019physics, hofherr2023neural} as the most adequate parameter estimator so far to compare with since they claim to overcome the challenges of approaches previously mentioned.

On the one hand, \citep{jaques2019physics} uses traditional AE with a physics engine in the middle. The physics engine uses the Euler method to make predictions, and the model's objective is to reconstruct inputs and predictions from latent space representations. The model also incorporates an unet in the encoder to learn segmentation mask for the object of interest in an unsupervised way; the capability to learn this mask is linked to the spatial transformer (ST) they use in the decoder similar to \citep{hsieh2018learning}. The main disadvantages of \citep{jaques2019physics} are the model's limitations to motion dynamics. In the same way, the spatial transformation needs to be manually modified depending on the system's transformation (translation or rotation). Besides, they barely mention parameter estimation, in which performance depends on the initialization value. Finally, they used an MLP to predict velocity instead of calculating them from positions, and the positions found in latent space are not shown.

On the other hand, \citep{hofherr2023neural} uses a differentiable ode solver to estimate the parameters. This model also uses a spatial transformer, but at the pixel level, it is displaced by the prediction made using the ode. The model needs to be trained, along with the use of masks, to learn which pixels should be translated. Finally, using frame reconstruction to achieve parameter estimation is difficult and slow to train since reconstructing frames from low dimensional data (i.e. set of positions and velocities). Therefore \citep{jaques2019physics, weiss2020correspondence, hofherr2023neural} need to limit their scope consisting because of the (ST) \citep{hsieh2018learning}, excluding dynamical systems like changes in intensity, colour, deformations and not uniform scale among others.

\section{Methods}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=0.7\textwidth]{architecture.svg}
    \caption{Overview of the methodology. Video displays a dynamics $z$ with a separation $\delta t$ each frame is proceeded by the encoder $E(\cdot)$, getting the unsupervised latent representation, the function $P(\cdot)$ generates a prediction of the future step $t+1$ we can compare with the encoded representation of the corresponding frame. On the \textbf{Top-right} is the loss function used to fit the model; the first part ensures the prediction fits with the encoding, while the second expression adds variance to $z$.}
    \label{fig:arqu}
\end{figure}

Our approach consists of estimating parameters of a known governing equation from a video recording; since it is unsupervised, we can just relay in the frames and the known frame rate denoted from now as $\delta t$. We restricted the study to autonomous differential equations with the form:

\begin{equation}
    z^{(n)}+ \gamma_{n-1} z^{(n-1)} + ... + \gamma_{1} z^{(1)} + \gamma_{0} z = 0
   \label{eq:autonODE}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:autonODE} is used to describe an n-order system, where $z$ is the "dynamic variable" since it is the value that changes with respect to time, therefore  $z^{k}, \quad k = 1, 2,...n $  is the $k-$derivative of $z$ and $\gamma_i , i = 0,1,..n-1$ are the parameters of the equation we want to estimate. To simplify the explanation, we will consider a second-order differential equation:

\begin{equation}
   z^{(2)}+ \gamma_1 z^{(1)} + \gamma_0 z = 0 
   \label{eq:secondOrder}
\end{equation}



\textbf{Encoder:} is a network $E(x)$ that maps images $x \in R^{w\times h \times  c}$ to the dynamic variable $z \in R^d$. For this we use an MLP in \citep{jaques2019physics} showed that MLP are enough to use as localization networks when objects are masked. while some solutions attempt to learn mask 

\begin{equation*}
  E : R^{w\times h \times  c} \rightarrow R^d
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
   z_t  = E(x_t, \theta)
   \label{eq:E}
\end{equation}

\textbf{The physics block:}  consist in the numerical solution of the differential equation \ref{eq:secondOrder} using Euler's method:


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:eulers}
    z_{t+1} = z_{t} + \delta t   z^{(1)}_{t}   \\
    z^{(1)}_{t+1} = z^{(1)}_{t} + \delta t z^{(2)}_{t}\\
    z^{(1)}_t \approx \frac{ z_{t+1} - z_{t} }{ \delta t  } \approx \frac{ z_{t} - z_{t-1} }{ \delta t  }    
\end{eqnarray}

Replacing in  Equations \ref{eq:eulers}  with equation \ref{eq:secondOrder} we can rewrite the physics block as:

\begin{equation}
   \hat{z}_{t+1} = z_{t} + \delta t \left( z^{(1)}_{t} - \delta t ( \gamma_1 z^{(1)}_t + \gamma_0 z_t ) \right)
   \label{eq:phys2or}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
  P : R^d \rightarrow R^d
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
   \hat{z}_{t+1} = P(z_{t}, .. z_{t-n}; \bf{\gamma} )
   \label{eq:physblock}
\end{equation}

Where $\gamma_i$, $i = 0,1..$ are set as learnable parameters, for notation we can say that the predicted latent space is a function $P(\cdot ,\bf{\gamma} )$ of the latent representations of $n$ previous frames. we use the notation $ \mathbf{\hat{z}}$ for the latent spaces predicted using function $P$ that are different than $\mathbf{z}$ predicted from the encoder. It is important to consider the framework's capabilities and the physic's understanding to guarantee that the \ref{eq:physblock} can be differentiated.



\textbf{Training:} To train the model, we input multiple frames in sequence with $x = (frames, channels, width, height)$. We calculate z for each frame $t$, therefore $z = (frames, d )$, from Eq \ref{eq:eulers} with $T$ frames we can predict $T-n$ frames and in the same way using our encoder, we can find the latent representation of $T$ frames, in particular, we can find the following two vectors:





\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\hat{z}}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \hat{z}_{n}\\
        \vdots\\
        \hat{z}_{t+1}\\
        \vdots          \\
        \hat{z}_{T}
        \end{bmatrix} 
        = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        P(z_{n-1}, \dots, z_{0}; \mathbf{\gamma}  )\\
        \vdots\\
        P(z_{t}, \dots,z_{t-n}; \mathbf{\gamma} )\\
        \vdots          \\
        P(z_{T-1}, \dots,  z_{T-n}; \mathbf{\gamma} )\\
        \end{bmatrix}   \\
    \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.45\linewidth}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{z}=
       \begin{bmatrix}
        z_{n}\\
        \vdots\\
        z_{t+1}\\
        \vdots          \\
        z_{T}
        \end{bmatrix} 
        = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        E(x_n )\\
        \vdots\\
        E(x_{t+1} )\\
        \vdots          \\
        E(z_{T} )\\
        \end{bmatrix}   \\
    \end{equation}
\end{minipage}




\textbf{Loss function:} the loss function is one of our contributions not used before in parameter estimation, 

In the first place, we want to compare how close the prediction of $\mathbf{z}$ to $\mathbf{\hat{z}}$ since we want them to be equal, the first part of our loss function is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_1 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - \hat{z}_i)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Bigl[ E(x_i) - P \bigl(E(x_{i-1}), \dots,E(x_{i-n})  \bigr) \Bigr] ^2
    \label{eq:L1}
\end{equation}

However, one problem with this approach is the convergence to the trivial solution such that $E(x; \theta) = 0 \quad \forall x$ and $P(z;\gamma) = 0  \quad \forall z$, under those conditions $ L1 = 0$ satisfying the condition. To avoid this problem, we want to induce some variance in the encoder's output; then, we propose to assume $z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ will define the range of $z$, in \ref{} a normalization over the number of pixels is done. The range of $z$ is defined, but we find that the model is independent of the normalization factor, and this can be applied based on the knowledge of the problem. Therefore, the  selection of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ won't change the performance of the model; for this work we picked $\mu=0$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_1 + \mathcal{L}_2 =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - \hat{z}_i)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum \bigl(1 + ln( \sigma_{z}^2 ) - \mu_{z}^2 -  \sigma_{z}^2 \bigr)
\end{equation}

The goal of the loss function in approach consists of $E(\cdot; \theta)$ is going to map images to random values, $L_2$ guarantees those values to be in a normal distribution, then function  $P(\cdot; \gamma)$ gives the sense of order and relation between latent spaces from different frames. Since we are analyzing a single video $z$ contains information about the temporal properties of the frame. Finally, $L_1$ makes the model consistent since predictions made by $P(\cdot; \gamma)$ were seen by $E(\cdot; \theta)$.

KL-divergence is used differently, while VAE assumes the encoder finds the belonging distribution, and with the sampling trick, one gets the value to input to the decoder. In our proposal, we do not sample from the distribution and expect the encoder to learn the dynamics variable. Thus, we calculate the mean $\mu_{z}$ and variance $\sigma_{z}^2$ over the batch.



\section{Experiments}

The experiments were run on a GPU Nvidia 3080; the length of the dataset is 500 samples with 20 frames, with a final size of $(samples, frames, channels, with, height) = (500,20,1,50,50)$. We wanted to extend problems beyond motion problems. Thus, we created synthetic datasets for three different dynamical systems; each uses an image size of $(50,50)$, and the simulated dynamics are the same for the three datasets normalized on the needs of each particular design.

\textbf{Motion} systems can be understood as problems where pixels have a translation or rotation transformation; in nature, some examples can be pendulums, springs, celestial mechanics, etc. To create this dataset we normalized the dynamics between $[-0.5,0.5]$, then we calculated the angle by transforming it to radians and generate the image with the given angle. Most of the literature centres on this kind of problem.

\textbf{Intensity} consists of the change of pixel values; this problem can be seen in nature in neuron spiking or photonic crystals. To create this dataset, we picked a shape and assigned all of the pixels inside the shape the corresponding value of Intensity; for this dataset, the normalized dynamics was in the range $[0.2,1.0] \sim [51,255]$ 

\textbf{Scale}, in which we have a change in the number of pixels representing our object of interest, can be related to the growing bacteria population or liquid diffusion. For this dataset we created a filled circle where there radius is proportional to the dynamics. However, this scale is not uniform; while half of the circle grows, the other half becomes smaller and vice versa. For this we normalized the dymics to $[-10,10]$.


Most state-of-the-art methods use simulated datasets similar to ours.  The pendulum system is a typical case of study, but for scale and intensity, there were no other baselines.  In Figure \ref{fig:baseexp} we illustrate the behavior of the three different datasets.

    \caption{Example of the synthetic dataset used, each row has a different problem and the columns represent different sampled times.}
    \label{fig:baseexp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Accuracy}

The first experiment consists of evaluating how accurate the model is in learning the parameters of the equation; for this experiment, we used different equations; for the 1-order system, $\gamma_0$ represents the decay factor, while for the 2-order system, $\gamma_0$ is the natural frequency and $\gamma_1$ is related to the damping factor.

\subsection{Latent Space Evaluation}
This experiment aims to evaluate the predicted dynamics of $E(\cdot)$ compared with the dynamics used to simulate. In Figure \ref{fig:LatenSpacePred}, we show the model's capabilities to predict dynamics out of the training set. Due to the physics priors, the model can make this generalization. We can see the most accurate experiment is with the Intensity dataset; it relates to the fact that dynamics is in pixels, and then in this problem, we have $200$ possible values.  In contrast, the discrete steps are larger in the scale and motion experiments; in particular, for the scale problem, we can have a total of $20$ different frames.

\subsection{Robustness and Stability}
For this we initialize parameters of Equation \ref{eq:secondOrder} in a range of $[-10.0, 10.0]$, with dynamics equation \ref{eq:phys2or} with parameters $\gamma_0 = 4$ and $\gamma = 0.08$. In Figure \ref{fig:Robustness}, we can see the parameter prediction using different initialization to evaluate the robustness.  As can be seen, the model converges close to the expected value independent of the initialization; the results in table \ref{tb:ExperimentsBase} show the precision of this experiment. Besides, the shading area allows us to see the variance while in training and evidence the model's capability to converge.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}


In our research, we could not find works that studied phenomena other than motion; we wanted to include a variety of problems in this work.

Frame prediction is a challenging problem that can be used for further visualization and used as a generator. However, this requires a decoder that needs to be crafted based on the dynamics; otherwise, it fails in generalization. Since our approach requires hand-crafted decoders for particular problems, we could analyze and apply them to different dynamical systems.

We also analyzed what is happening in the latent space; whether the other state-of-the-art solutions focus on the frame reconstruction, we centred on the physics. Therefore, our method can be used to annotate data or embed it in other architectures and separate the encoder-decoder pipeline for more modular architecture.

While learning the masks is an interest solutions proposed in \citep{hsieh2018learning, jaques2019physics} how ever their method is highly dependent of the spatial transformer, therefore to learn mask in our pipeline we may need ground thoruths or come up with a novel solution.


\textbf{Limitations}

The research in this area has not been explored well; therefore, some extensions of the experiments are still needed. This includes combining dynamics or multiple entities in a scene with independent dynamics.  

We work over masks. Some solutions try to learn the mask, but those methods need to be explored with more realistic data,  while the solution with realistic data needs masks to train.

We used continuous differentiable autonomous differential equations. However, some systems are described with more complex or partial differential equations.

\section*{NeurIPS Paper Checklist}

%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.} The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material.  The checklist does NOT count towards the page
limit. 

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You should answer \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item \answerNA{} means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
    \item Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA). 
   % \item {\bf The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.}
\end{itemize}

{\bf The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.} They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "\answerYes{}" is generally preferable to "\answerNo{}", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "\answerNo{}" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "\answerNo{}" or "\answerNA{}" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer \answerYes{} to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading ``NeurIPS paper checklist"},
    \item  {\bf Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.}
    \item {\bf Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers}.
\end{itemize} 
 

%%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Claims}
    \item[] Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
        \item The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 
        \item The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 
        \item It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Limitations}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
        \item The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
        \item The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
        \item The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
        \item The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
        \item The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
        \item If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
        \item While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Theory Assumptions and Proofs}
    \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. 
        \item All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
        \item All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
        \item The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. 
        \item Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
        \item Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. 
    \end{itemize}

    \item {\bf Experimental Result Reproducibility}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
        \item If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
        \item Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
        \item While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
            \item If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
            \item If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
            \item We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Open access to data and code}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
        \item Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
        \item While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
        \item The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (\url{https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy}) for more details.
        \item The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
        \item The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
        \item At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
        \item Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
    \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Experimental Setting/Details}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
        \item The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Experiment Statistical Significance}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
        \item The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
        \item The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
        \item The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
        \item It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
        \item It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96\% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
        \item For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
        \item If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Experiments Compute Resources}
    \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
        \item The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
        \item The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. 
        \item The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). 
    \end{itemize}
    
\item {\bf Code Of Ethics}
    \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics \url{https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines}?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
        \item If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
        \item The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
    \end{itemize}


\item {\bf Broader Impacts}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
        \item If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
        \item Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
        \item The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
        \item The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
        \item If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
    \end{itemize}
    
\item {\bf Safeguards}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
        \item Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
        \item Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
        \item We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Licenses for existing assets}
    \item[] Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
        \item The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
        \item The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
        \item The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
        \item For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
        \item If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, \url{paperswithcode.com/datasets} has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
        \item For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
        \item If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
    \end{itemize}

\item {\bf New Assets}
    \item[] Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?
    \item[] Answer: \answerTODO{} % Replace by \answerYes{}, \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.
    \item[] Justification: \justificationTODO{}
    \item[] Guidelines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
        \item Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. 
        \item The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
        \item At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
